            <p>
              One of the initial phases in the development of our project was to conduct a brainstorming session and present the results in the form of a glitch project.
            </p>
            <p>
              This will offer you a better idea of the spirit we want to instill in our application, as well as its identity, motives, and primary objectives.

                <p>After that, we created a wireframe for our project. This was a first sketch of how our application will appear, while specifying the size and positioning of page components, application features, conversion areas, and navigation for our application. It gave us the opportunity to consider how we could improve the user experience throughout our application.

                These mockups will help you visualize how our application will appear and how we want it to be developed, created, and designed. More specifically, we began our mockups with merely the core element of our concept. Then we put it to the test with real users. We improved the mockups as a result of the testers' input.

              Following reviews of the data that would be entered into the database, and the requirements of retrieving the data several criteria were identified that need to be met by the database software. The minimum requirements for the software were:

                Must support the relational database model, and some version of the SQL language. This is an industry standard, and as a program that will be spanning several countries and many years adhering to this standard will ensure the longevity and portability of the database. In addition most database administrators are familiar with some form of SQL and relational databases, so training of an administrator will be relatively easy.
              </p>
            </div>

                Need to allow multiple users to access tables simultaneously. Since the data is going to be entered by users from different countries and numerous educational institutions, it is likely that multiple people will be entering data into the same table at the same time.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div class="three columns">
              <h5>3.</h5>
              <p>
                Allow running of stored SQL scripts. There are many processes that can be automated with stored scripts, to facility management, updates, editing, and querying of the database. This is especially important if users are accessing the data from the internet. Being able to call and run a stored script is far easier and more efficient than trying to code all the information into a web form.

            <div class="three columns">

              <p>
                Allow restrictions on the data values entered in columns within a table. Being able to restrict the data to certain ranges or values will reduce the possible errors in data entry.

              <h5>5.</h5>
              <p>
                Allow creation of multiple indexes on a table, as well as unique indexes within a table. Also must be able to create one index on multiple columns. Multiple indexes on a table allow faster sorts and queries based on various parameters.
              </p>
              <p>Creating a unique index across multiple columns will prevent entering duplicate data.</p>

              <h5>7.</h5>
              <p>
                Allow inner joins, left outer joins, right outer joins, full outer joins, and multiple joins within a query. The joins are different ways of selecting items from one or more tables, in either a query or a view.
              </p>

              <h5>8.</h5>
              <p>
                Allow triggers on the data tables. Triggers will allow predetermined actions to be taken when information is entered, edited, or deleted from a data table. Column data checks are an intrinsic form of triggers.

                Based on these requirements the qualified software was examined was Oracle, Informix, Ingres, and PostgreSQL. All of these products met the requirements outlined above. PostgreSQL offered the best price/performance of the qualified software. Based on research of the computer literature, PostgreSQL appeared to serve data over the web as fast or nearly as fast as any of the other products. Also being an open source program there is no upfront cost to acquiring the software. Based on the cost and performance PostgreSQL was chosen as the software to use for this project.
